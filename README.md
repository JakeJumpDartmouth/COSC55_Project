# Securing Data in Transit with a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
## COSC55_Project
*Jake Jump and Oliver Long*

This is the repo for our COSC55 final project. 

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a secure, dynamic web application hosted on AWS, utilizing EC2 instances for both front-end and back-end services. The application features a login system that authenticates users and redirects them to department-specific pages based on their credentials. The project emphasizes security, with HTTPS encryption, private IP communication between instances, and managed SSL/TLS certificates.

All html and php files used are in this repo.
